# Chapter 36: Islamic Extremism in Asia - The Bali Bombings

After examining the nuclear threat in North Korea in the previous chapter, we now switch our attention to Islamic Extremism in Asia. This form of terrorism has been a significant concern for the global community, and a number of countries in Asia have faced serious threats from violent extremist groups. Islamic Extremism has also led to several acts of violence against innocent civilians in different parts of Asia.

In this chapter, we will be focusing on the Bali Bombings, which were carried out by the extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). This attack on October 12, 2002, targeted Western tourists visiting the popular tourist destination of Bali in Indonesia. The attack resulted in the deaths of 202 people, most of whom were foreign nationals. This was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the history of Indonesia and the worst in the nation's history since the 2002 Bali bombings.

Over the course of this chapter, we will explore the motives behind this heinous attack, the perpetrators involved, and the global implications of Islamic Extremism in Asia. We will also provide a comprehensive timeline of the events that led up to the Bali bombings, including the terrorist group's formation and its subsequent operations in Southeast Asia.

As with all chapters in our textbook, we aim to provide a factual and informative account of this event, while also highlighting its impact on Asia and the world. We encourage readers to engage with the content of this chapter critically and to seek out other sources of information for a more detailed and nuanced understanding of Islamic Extremism in Asia.

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes was invited to Indonesia by the local authorities to investigate the Bali Bombings. He was given access to all the evidence collected so far and began his investigation by visiting the bombing site.

After examining the site in detail, Holmes noticed something peculiar about the placement of the bomb. It was placed near the entrance of the nightclub, which meant that the majority of the crowd was in the way when it went off. He found it odd that the bomber would choose to place the bomb there instead of inside the crowd.

Upon further investigation, Holmes discovered that the bomb was not actually set off by a timer, as was originally believed, but by a mobile phone. This led him to believe that the bomber was in close proximity to the nightclub at the time of the explosion.

Furthermore, he deduced that the bomb was not carried into the nightclub by the bomber, as most people had believed, but rather it was planted there earlier by someone else.

Holmes turned his attention to the extremist group, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which was known to be responsible for the attack. He suspected that the operatives had received help from a local Indonesian network, that had knowledge of the area, and that the bomber had been trained in bomb-making outside the country with the help of international terrorist groups.

After questioning locals and investigating the hideouts of JI operatives, Holmes finally uncovered a crucial piece of information. One of the locals revealed that he had seen a suspicious-looking foreigner in the area a few weeks before the attack. He was able to provide a rough sketch of the person, which Holmes used to track down the suspect.

## The Resolution

Holmes' suspect was a foreign national who had been a resident of Indonesia for many years. He had ties to international terrorist organizations and had trained in bomb-making. Holmes was able to link the suspect to Jemaah Islamiyah's local network and their overseas counterparts.

It became clear that the suspect had acted as an intermediary between the operatives who planted the bomb at the nightclub and the wider network. He had been responsible for delivering the bomb and helping the bombers to escape undetected. With this evidence, the Indonesian police were able to make an arrest and charge him with orchestrating the Bali Bombings.

The resolution to this horrific event offered a valuable lesson in the growing threat of Islamic extremism across Asia. It emphasized the need for international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the importance of intelligence gathering. The Bali Bombings served as a wakeup call for not only Indonesia but for the entire world, highlighting the need for increased attention to combating violent extremism.
In conclusion, the Bali Bombings was an incredibly tragic event, which shed light on the growing threat of Islamic extremism in Asia. Through the keen investigative work of Sherlock Holmes, we were able to gain insight into the motives behind the attacks, the perpetrators involved, and the global implications of the incident.

Holmes' work highlighted the vital importance of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism, both within Asia and with the wider international community. The Bali Bombings were a stark reminder that violent extremism is a complex and multidimensional issue that requires ongoing attention and vigilance.

As we move forward, it is clear that the fight against terrorism is far from over. However, by continuing to learn from events such as the Bali Bombings, we can work towards a safer, more secure world, where acts of terrorism are no longer a threat to innocent civilians.
